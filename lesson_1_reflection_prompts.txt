How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

Git helps to quickly and efficiently find differences between two files.
By using git I don't have to look through each line of code, which would be
very tiring in case of a long program.



How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

If I am able to see the previous version of a file, it can help me: 
to understand why certain changes were made
to understand how those changes improved the file
to understand what kind of attempts were made earlier 
(so that I won't try certain things again, it saves times and energy)
to learn from other people's ideas



What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Pros:
I can decide what is a logical unit that is worth committing
I can regulate how many commits are made
I can avoid unnecessarily commits

Cons:
it is problematic if I forget about it




Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git allows saving multiple files in one commit because the different files
are dependent on each other, there are connections between them.
If they weren't saved in one commit, later on, some parts of the program 
would not work.
In Google Docs, etc this is not an issue.




How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

With git log I can view the commit history of a file. Then, I can arbitrarily choose two versions of the file and check the differences between the two.




How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

Knowing that the changes I make can be tracked down easily provides a great
environment for experimenting. I wouldn't fear to break things.




Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I will use Git to handle files of my coding projects on GitHub.
