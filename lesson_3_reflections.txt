When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

I would use a remote repository when I want to or have to share my work with others.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Not all changes might be good, therefore only those should be pulled which I really want to have.



Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Forking is used on GitHub, when you want to clone someone else's repository.
Cloning is used when you want to clone a repository from GitHub to your computer, or when you want to clone sg on your computer.
Branches are used to create new branches from the master branch or other existing branches, so that you can experiment with the code without modifying the master branch or other existing branches.
